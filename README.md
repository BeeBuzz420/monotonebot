# Monotone Bot 
**An EPIC Discord bot written in JavaScript**

## Setting up your bot
To create your bot application, you can read official 
[discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)  
After getting the bot token you can copy it and put in `.env` file which will be explained in the
[running the bot](#runthebot) section

To adding your bot into your server [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html)  
The invite link should look like this:  
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=762578055939620864&permissions=8&scope=bot`

## <a name="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
* [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (bundled with nodejs)
* [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## <a name="env"></a> `.env` File
.env is file that stored super secret information like your bot token.  
Here is the list of variable you should put in .env file :
- `TOKEN` = Token from the application in [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
- `MONGO_URL` = Full url of mongodb cluster if you're using remote database

## <a name="runthebot"></a> Running the bot
After [prerequisites](#prereqs) are installed and your bot is already in your server,  
now to run it follow the step below:
1. Clone this repo with `git clone <this repo url>` or you can download zipped file .
1. Then move to the project root directory and you can begin with setting up the`.env` file.  
    First copy the [`.env.example`](https://gitlab.com/Cudiph/monotonebot/-/blob/master/.env.example)
    file still in the current directory then paste and rename it to only `.env`.  
    Now open the file and change the value of `TOKEN` with your secret bot token,  
    and `MONGO_URL` with your mongo database url.
1. After that you can install required dependencies with `yarn install`. (Make sure you're using
    yarn 2 with `yarn set version 2`)
1. Before starting the bot please check the mongodb service if it's running and if you're run mongo in local computer
1. And finally you can run the bot with command `yarn start` or `npm start`
1. Congrats! You've run the bot ü•≥
